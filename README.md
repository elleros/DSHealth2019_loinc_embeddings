# LOINC Embeddings

This repository provides the Python code and the Word2Vec embeddings to reproduce the scatter plots in the [KDD 2019 DSHealth Workshop](https://dshealthkdd.github.io/dshealth-2019/) paper "Evaluation of Embeddings of Laboratory Test Codes for Patients at a Cancer Center": [arxiv.org/abs/1907.09600](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09600). The code can be used as a starting point for furtrher in depth exploration of the embeddings.

The embeddings have been trained via Word2Vec skip-gram with EHR data from the [City of Hope National Medical Center](https://www.cityofhope.org/homepage). See paper for details on the training.
