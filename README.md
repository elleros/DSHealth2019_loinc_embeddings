# LOINC Embeddings

This repository provides the Python code and the Word2Vec embeddings to reproduce the scatter plots in the [KDD 2019 DSHealth Workshop](https://dshealthkdd.github.io/dshealth-2019/) paper "Evaluation of Embeddings of Laboratory Test Codes for Patients at a Cancer Center": [arxiv.org/abs/1907.09600](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09600). The code can be used as a starting point for further in depth explorations of the embeddings.

The embeddings have been trained via Word2Vec skip-gram with EHR data from the [City of Hope National Medical Center](https://www.cityofhope.org/homepage). See paper for details on the training.

If you produce interesting visualizations of the embeddings, email me at lorenzo **\[dot\]** rossi **\[at\]** gmail.com (lrossi **\[at\]** coh.org).

## Contents
* **tsne\_plot\_kdd_dshealth2019.ipynb** Jupyter notebook to generate the t-SNE plot.
* **Data/** folder containing the Word2Vec embeddings for the LOINC codes as well as other files used to produce the *t*-SNE plot

**Note** you need to download the official LOINC CSV Table from [loing.org](https://loinc.org). The table file is necessary to provide a taxonomy of the LOINC codes and hence the classes showed in different colors in the scatter plot.

### How to download the official Loinc Table CSV file
* Create an account on LOINC.org (it's free) and log in
* Click on 'Downloads' (menu at the top of the page)
* Click on 'LOINC Table'
* Click on 'LOINC Table File (CSV)'
* Review and check the review the Copyright and Terms of Use note
* Click on 'Download': a zip archive will be downloaded on your machine
* Extraxct Loinc.csv from the archive
